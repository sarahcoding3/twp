		<h3> About the author</h3>
<p>My name is Sarah and I've been journaling in some form for as long as I remember. My earliest memories bring me to a composition book diary, the marbled cover hiding terrible handwritings of elementary school gossip. Over the years, I've experiemented with countless forms of journalling. Classic, bullet, and just using a planner were large journaling phases that I somewhat stuck with, until it lead me to junk journalling. By saving physical recipts, ticket stubs, and other ephemera, I glued them into a notebook to save these memories for later in a collage style. Here on this website, I'm yet again, experimenting with another type of journaling, combined with a bit of blogging which is completely new to me. I hope my skills can increase in writing, photography, and analysis. You can email me at thisemailisfake@dontemailme.no, and my <a href="https://github.com/sarahcoding3" target="true">Github</a> here. Here is my favorite celebrityâ€™s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/junhui_moon/" target ="true">Instagram</a> in lieu of my own. Enjoy!</p>
